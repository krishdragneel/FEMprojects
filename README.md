🔧 MULTI-PHYSICS ANALYSIS OF GLOBE VALVE
📊 Comparative Study: Stainless Steel vs. Brass vs. Bronze

⚙️ ANSYS • 📐 Finite Element Analysis • 🌐 Multi-Physics Simulation

📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project presents a Finite Element Analysis (FEA)–based multi-physics study of a globe valve. The objective is to compare the 🏗️ structural, 🔊 vibrational, and 🌡️ thermal performance of different materials under realistic operating conditions relevant to industrial valve applications.

🧪 Materials analyzed in this study:
• 🧱 Stainless Steel
• 🟡 Brass
• 🟤 Bronze

🧠 ANALYSES PERFORMED

🔊 MODAL ANALYSIS

Natural frequency and mode shape analysis was performed to evaluate vibration characteristics and resonance safety in mechanically excited environments.

🏗️ STATIC STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS

The globe valve was subjected to an internal pressure of 10 MPa and an external mechanical load of 500 N. Von-Mises stress and safety factor were used to assess structural integrity.

🌡️ THERMAL ANALYSIS

A steady-state thermal analysis was conducted for temperatures ranging from −35 °C to 450 °C to study heat flux and temperature distribution across the valve body.

📈 KEY RESULTS

🔊 Vibration Resistance: Stainless Steel showed the highest natural frequency and best resistance to resonance.

🏗️ Structural Safety: Bronze exhibited the highest safety factor under pressure loading.

🌡️ Heat Dissipation: Bronze demonstrated superior thermal conductivity.

❄️ Thermal Insulation: Stainless Steel retained heat effectively due to low thermal conductivity.

✅ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

🏗️ Structural safety → Bronze

🔊 Vibration-critical applications → Stainless Steel

🌡️ Thermal applications:
• 🔥 Heat dissipation → Bronze
• ❄️ Heat retention → Stainless Steel
